## The story so far...

Universe created.
Some time passes.
Dinosaurs. Rawr!
Romans invent concrete.

2001: v1 of this site.

2001-2022: Various updates.

2023: This rebuild starts.

## Your timeline is vague...

Well, yeah.

## Seriously though...

I've been a web developer for a long time. Like, I got started on [Gopher](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)>) and the first
web page I built was for [Netscape Navigator](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_(web_browser)#Netscape-based_(versions_1.0%E2%80%934.8)_releases>). It had am image. I was very proud.

Then I spent a decade or two doing doing Web Development eventually working my
way to to Lead Front-end Developer at [ETS](https://www.ets.org/) with strong focus on standards, #a11y, and usability. And, it was fun while it lasted. Sadly we get to 2023 and my role is getting outsourced.

As part of that process I've been told having a "portfolio site" would be a Good Thing. So I'm using my time to build out something for the world to see and as a place where I can do a better job of brain dumping all the nifty tricks 2+ decades of front-end coding teaches you.

## Okay, so what exactly are you doing...

We're going to work through building out a site using:

- Gatsby v5

  Versions 3 and 4 were spiffy but I've not had a chance to do anything with v5 until now. With all the under the hood changes (Helmet, I'm looking at you...) it should be fun

## Sounds like fun...

It does, doesn't it?!
