## The story so far...

Universe created.  
Some time passes.  
Dinosaurs. Rawr!  
Romans invent concrete.  
2001. v1 of this site.  
2001-2023. Various updates.
2024: Again?! Yes. But, this time with React + Vite + Tailwind.

## Your timeline is vague...

Well, yeah.

## Seriously though...

I've been a web developer for a long time. Like, I got started on [Gopher](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)>) and the first
web page I built was for [Netscape Navigator](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_(web_browser)#Netscape-based_(versions_1.0%E2%80%934.8)_releases>). It had an image. I was very proud.

Then I spent a decade or two doing doing Web Development eventually working my
way to to Lead Front-end Developer at [ETS](https://www.ets.org/) with strong focus on standards, #a11y, and usability. Sadly we get to 2023 and my role is getting outsourced. It was fun while it lasted.

Good news though, the great folks at the Asplundh Digital Innovations group have opted to fund my adventures.
